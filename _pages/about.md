I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My current work focuses on socially expressive robots and behavior design that communicates robot mindset. Previously I worked as a social work case manager at William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital. I completed my BA in Social Welfare and Justice and Computational Mathematics at Marquette University in 2016, my Master of Social Work at UW-Madison in 2018, and my MS in Computer Science at UW-Madison in 2022. I am now conducting research in the People and Robots Lab under the direction of my advisor Dr. Bilge Mutlu.
